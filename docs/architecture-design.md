### 4.2 API Response Format

Standard response format for all endpoints:

```json
{
  "success": true|false,
  "data": {
    // Response data
  },
  "total": 100, // only for list endpoints
  "skip": 0, // only for list endpoints
  "limit": 20 // only for list endpoints
}
```

## 5. Data Models

### 5.1 Core Models
