# Architecture Requirements Document (ARD)

## 1. System Overview

Tech Compass (TC) is a platform designed to showcase and manage technical solutions for small to medium-sized enterprises. The platform facilitates the comparison, evaluation, and documentation of various technical solutions used in software development.

## 2. Architecture Goals and Constraints

### 2.1 Goals

- Create a platform for technical solution discovery and comparison
- Provide rating and feedback mechanisms for technical solutions
- Enable technical teams to make informed decisions about technology choices
- Support documentation of technical solutions with detailed information

### 2.2 Constraints

- System designed for small to medium tech departments (<1000 concurrent users)
- Authentication required for data modification
- Initial focus on core functionality without immediate scalability concerns

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 High-Level Components

The system consists of four main applications:

1. **TC UI (apps/tc-ui)**

   - Frontend application built with Angular + PrimeNG
   - Provides user interface for all main functionalities
   - Implements responsive design for various devices

2. **TC API (apps/tc-api)**

   - Backend service built with Python FastAPI
   - Handles all data operations and business logic
   - Provides RESTful API endpoints

3. **TC Admin (apps/tc-admin)**

   - Simple admin dashboard built with Python Streamlit
   - Provides administrative functions for data management

4. **TC Radar (apps/tc-radar)**
   - Technology radar visualization component
   - Based on open-source technology radar implementation

### 3.2 Data Architecture

#### Database

- MongoDB as the primary database
- Collections for:
  - Technical solutions
  - Ratings
  - Comments
  - Supplementary information
  - Links
  - Tags
  - Categories

## 4. API Design

### 4.1 Core API Endpoints

#### Technical Solutions

- GET /api/solutions - List all technical solutions
- GET /api/solutions/{id} - Get solution details
- POST /api/solutions - Create new solution
- PUT /api/solutions/{id} - Update solution
- DELETE /api/solutions/{id} - Delete solution

#### Ratings and Reviews

- GET /api/solutions/{id}/ratings - Get solution ratings
- POST /api/solutions/{id}/ratings - Add rating
- GET /api/solutions/{id}/comments - Get solution comments
- POST /api/solutions/{id}/comments - Add comment

#### Tags and Categories

- GET /api/tags - Get all tags
- GET /api/categories - Get all categories

## 5. Frontend Architecture

### 5.1 Key Pages

1. **Home Page**

   - Featured solutions
   - Quick access to popular items
   - Search functionality

2. **List Page**

   - Filterable solution list
   - Sort by various criteria
